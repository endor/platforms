NOTE: I started to merge four.w4lls with the Go project I am working on and some of the node.js peepcode. Not everything is working yet and I did not rename everything to skeleton yet. This is still work in progress.

What we still need to decide/figure out:

1) use expresso or jspec? expresso is more integration testing, jspec would be more unit testing.
2) use ejs or stick with mustache in client and server?
